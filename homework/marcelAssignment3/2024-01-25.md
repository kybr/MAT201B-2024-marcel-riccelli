## Physics



 

- In the real world...
  - Velocity is the [derivative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative) of Position
  - Acceleration is the derivative of Velocity
  - [Jerk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerk_(physics)) is the derivative of Acceleration
- In computer simulations...
  - Acceleration comes from made up forces
  - Velocity comes from accumulating Acceleration starting as some _initial velocity_ 
  - Position comes from accumulating Velocity starting as some _initial position_

















Here's some equations for parabolic motion:

- $X_t = -5(t-5)^2 + 3(t-5) + 8$
- $V_t = -10(t-5) + 3$
- $A_t = -10$ (note that no $t$ means that $A_t$​ is constant—Does not change according to time)



$y = e^{-x^2}$

















## Euler's method

...is the most basic of the [numerical methods for ordinary differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_methods_for_ordinary_differential_equations). There's a whole world of these methods, each with its pros and cons.

When you see this, you're using [Euler's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method):

```Java
position.add(velocity);
velocity.add(acceleration);
```

Given some [initial conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_condition) and rules for acceleration, velocity, and position we may use accumulation to extrapolate the position of some particle at some time. We need the position in order to draw the particle. Euler's method suffers from drift and instability. It is not physically accurate, especially with small time steps, but it works well enough a lot of the time and it is relatively cheap to compute.











## Semi-Implicit Euler

See [Gaffer on Games ~ Integration Basics](https://gafferongames.com/post/integration_basics) for a good treatment of basic numerical methods for integration in the context of games. We recommend a tweak on Euler:

```c++
velocity.add(acceleration);
position.add(velocity);
```

(We switched the order of the lines.)















**Physical Simulation**

1. Calculate forces and accumulate them for each physical object
2. Add drag force
3. Compute `F = ma` to get acceleration
4. Accumulate velocity given acceleration (Euler)
5. Accumulate position given velocity (Euler)
6. Clear all forces
7. Draw objects given position
8. Repeat









#### Most of the physics you'll need for making stuff

- $F = ma$ ... but in lots of sims $m = 1$, so $F = a$
- Gravitation :: [Newton's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation) :: $F = G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$
- Repulsion :: [Coulombs law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb%27s_law)* :: $F = k_e \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$
- Springs :: [Hook's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law) :: $F = -kX$ ... $F = -k(X_r - X_e)$
- (Simplified) [Drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)) :: $ F_d \propto -v$ or $F_d \propto -v^2$
- Stam's Stable Fluids :: ...
- [Ferromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetism) :: ... 
- Love (asymmetrical attraction): $F = ?$

These just show the relationships between force/acceleration and charge, mass, tension, and friction. These don't show you how to calculate position and/or velocity. For all of these, you'll use Euler's method or some other numerical integration method.

\* Note that Coulomb's law is for "static electrically charged particles". This is an inverse square law. But the things we refer to a "magnets" are different. They are like two oppositely charged particles glued together--These are called "dipoles" and they follow an inverse _cubed_ law. See [Why does the magnetic field obey an inverse cube law?](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-magnetic-field-obey-an-inverse-cube-law)

(Again [Hyperphysics](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Newt.html) is a cool resource.)

















## Assignment 3 ~ Due Wednesday by 5pm

Make a sphere of charged particles. First force each particle to the surface of a sphere as if it were attached by a spring (Hook's law). Now force each particle away from all other particles as if all the particles have positive charge (Coulomb's law). Start with `particle.cpp` which already does semi-implicit Euler integration as drag force.

Once your physics code is correct, your values for spring stiffness and charge constant and drag will need to be tuned carefully. This can be tricky. Here are some tips:

* start the value at zero and increase slowly observing behavior
  * is the behavior correct? do you have the physics code right?
* test one kind of force at a time
  * make sure springs work before moving on to charge
* add values to the GUI
  * you can tune them while the simulation is running
* if particles bounce around like crazy, try
  * increasing drag
  * decreasing time step

Once you have this all done, introduce an assymetrical force (love or hunger) to make the particles move around and chase each other.
